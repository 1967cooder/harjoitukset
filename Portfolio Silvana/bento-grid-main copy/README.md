## Features

- **Grid layout:** The `.bento-grid` container uses CSS Grid with 4 columns on desktop.
- **Nested grid:** The first column (`.column-1`) is a grid itself with two stacked cards.
- **Flexible cards:** Cards adapt in size and position for different screen widths.
- **Mobile friendly:** On smaller screens (below 768px), the layout switches to a single column flex layout.
- **Custom styling:** Cards have distinct background colors, shadows, and text styles matching the challenge design.
- **Accessible images:** All images have descriptive alt attributes.
