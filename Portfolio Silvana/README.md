# Silvana Lindholm - Personal Portfolio

**Welcome to my Portfolio!** 

This is my personal website where you’ll find my **projects, skills, certificates, and education background** — as well as ways to connect with me.  

I created this portfolio to present my work in a clean, modern, and responsive way.  
It’s not only a collection of projects, but also a reflection of my growth as I continue to learn new technologies.
