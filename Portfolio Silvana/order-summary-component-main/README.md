## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Red Hat Display)
- Vanilla JavaScript (optional for interactive elements)

### What I Learned

During this project, I learned:

- How to create a **clean card layout** using Flexbox and Grid
- Implementing **mobile-first responsive design**
- Styling **hover states** and buttons consistently
- Using **semantic HTML5** elements for accessibility
- Structuring the markup to match a **design mockup**

## Example of a CSS snippet I was proud of:

```css
.link-button{
    display: block;/*laattikko*/
    margin: 20px;
    background-color: blue;
    width: 85%;
    padding: 15px;
    color: white;
    border-radius: 5px;

 }

#plan-price {
    text-align: left;
    flex-grow: 3;
    padding-left: 10px;
}
```

## Continued Development

I plan to further improve by:

Adding JavaScript interactivity, e.g., toggle between annual/monthly plans

Exploring CSS animations for smoother hover effects

Enhancing accessibility with better ARIA roles
